# Diameter-Estimation-of-Retinal-Vessels
The Scope of this project is to determine the approximate diameter/width of a blood vessel segment.

In order to make the project generalized ,the input for this project is retinal fundus images from which the blood vessel segment map will be extracted(Blood Vessel Segment Map).

Once the Blood Vessel is Segmented ,user is supposed to choose the segment for which the user has to find out the diameter for (User Segment Extraction).

Diameter will be displayed for the chosen segment of the blood vessel segment(Diameter Calculation).
